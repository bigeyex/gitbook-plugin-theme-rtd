# gitbook-plugin-theme-rtd
a port of Read the Docs theme to Gitbook.

If you like read-the-docs theme, but do not want to play with Sphinx,  
and you think Gitbook toolchain is better than MKDocs,  
this is your choice.

It is still working in progress.  
And this is a "fork" of base theme instead of an extension. That means,  
some other Gitbook plugins may not work. 

## Features

- A neat sidebar, including the SUMMARY and table of contents of the current page.

TODO:
- [] add language switcher to the top of the page
- [] add more block markups (e.g. info....)
- [] fix h2 titles

## Install

```
{
    "plugins": ["theme-rtd"]
}
```

then `gitbook install`.
